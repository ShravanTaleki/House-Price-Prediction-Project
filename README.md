House Price Prediction Project.

This project focuses on predicting house prices using Python and machine learning techniques. It begins with data preprocessing steps to handle missing values and encode categorical variables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the distribution of sale prices and explore correlations between features using visualizations like histograms and correlation matrices. Key insights from EDA guide feature selection and engineering processes.

The predictive model is built using Linear Regression, leveraging scikit-learn for model training and evaluation. Performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared are employed to assess the model's accuracy in predicting house prices. The project showcases a comprehensive workflow from data cleaning and visualization to model deployment, providing a practical example of applying machine learning to real estate data analysis.
