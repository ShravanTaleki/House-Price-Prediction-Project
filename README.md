# 🏡 House Price Prediction Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using Python and machine learning techniques. It covers the complete workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation, offering a practical approach to real estate data analysis.

Key steps include:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding price distributions and feature correlations through histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
- **Feature Selection & Engineering**: Selecting impactful variables based on statistical insights.
- **Model Development**: Using **Linear Regression** to predict house prices.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing accuracy with **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (R²)**.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Extensive **EDA** with visualizations (histograms, heatmaps, scatter plots).  
✅ **Feature Selection** to improve model efficiency.  
✅ **Linear Regression Model** for price prediction.  
✅ **Evaluation Metrics** including **RMSE** and **R² Score**.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python 🐍**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Handling & Preprocessing)
- **Scikit-learn** (Linear Regression, Feature Selection)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
